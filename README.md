# PlayFIt
The PlayFit is more kind of game rather than exercise tracking system, made for the kids. It not only tracks whether the user are doing exercise correctly or not also give the real time feedback. It contains Pose estimation system that tracks the user's body and movement. Also integrated 2d cartoon character helps to engage kids with this game.
